Description:
Using machine learning and DSP to automatically generate remixes\ beats out of given
samples. SOTA machine learning models are already able to compose (via MIDI) and
also generate audio. This begs the possibility of an AI “flipping” a sample, i.e. slicing it to
different “chops” and rearranging it while adding drums - a common technique used in
hip hop production. This might also be extended to remixing entire songs.


Challenges:

● Collecting data: probably best making a beat-making app, but possibly collecting
DAW projects

● Adapting current SOTA models (see Magenta etc.) to the tasks of rearranging
chops\ adding drums.
